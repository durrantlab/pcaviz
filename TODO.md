Need to add chains into PCA json file.
Recheck closure compiler.
Periodically recalculate secondary structure?
Javascript code should also incorporate chain.
Also, calculate bonds based on first frame, not average frame.

Problems:
Cumulative variance exceeds 1.0.
Even when all vectors are present, it does not match that closely.
