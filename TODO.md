Style problem... no way to specify atom selection? In plugin or javascript?

Problems:
Periodically recalculate secondary structure?
Recheck closure compiler.
Need to add chains into PCA json file.
Also, calculate bonds based on first frame, not average frame.
Javascript code should also incorporate chain.
Cumulative variance exceeds 1.0.
Even when all vectors are present, it does not match that closely.
